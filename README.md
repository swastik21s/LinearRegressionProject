# LinearRegressionProject

Project Overview
In this guided project from the Udemy course "Python for Data Science" by Jose Portilla, we will analyze a dataset from an e-commerce company based in New York City. This company sells clothing online and also provides in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers visit the store for personalized stylist sessions and subsequently order clothes online via a mobile app or website.

The company seeks to determine whether to focus their efforts on improving the mobile app experience or the website. To aid in this decision, we will analyze customer data to answer the following questions:

What is the relationship between different features and the yearly amount spent by customers?
Which feature(s) are the most significant predictors of the yearly amount spent?
